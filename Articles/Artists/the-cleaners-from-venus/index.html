          <p><p>The <mark><strong>Cleaners from Venus</mark></strong> are a British Lo-Fi band formed in Wivenhoe, England in 1980 by Martin Newell and Lawrence Elliot. They are known for their musical style, inspired by &quot;mid-1960s pop influences, driven by punk energy&quot;.</p>
<h5>History - Initial run (1980-85)</h5>
<p>The Cleaners From Venus were founded in November 1980 by <mark>Martin Newell</mark> and <mark>Lawrence &quot;Lol&quot; Elliot</mark>. Disillusioned by their experiences in the music industry, they began creating home recordings on a 4-track Tascam Portastudio. Inspired by Anarchist ideals, they distributed cassette tapes via mail as opposed to distribution deals, writing pieces in zines in exchange for reviews and promotion.</p>
<p>Despite the band's rudimentary recording process, they were well-received for their sound and songwriting, producing five albums <mark>[Blow Your Troubles Away, Midnight Cleaners, On Any Normal Monday, In The Golden Autumn]</mark> independently.</p>
<p>In 1984, shortly after completing their fifth album <mark>[Under Wartime Conditions]</mark> Elliot departed the band, marking the end of the &quot;original&quot; Cleaners run. Under Wartime Conditions received a vinyl release on independent German label Modell in 1985.</p>
<p>In 1985, Martin Newell released <mark>Songs For a Fallow Land</mark>, a solo project of his, though it has since been &quot;Retconed&quot; into the <em>Cleaners'</em> canon.</p>
<h5>&quot;Cleaners Mk. II&quot; and Breakup (1986-88)</h5>
<p>The Second <em>Cleaners</em> run began in 1986 with the joining of keyboardist <mark>Giles Smith</mark>, recording the cassette album <mark>Living With Victoria Grey</mark>. Following the advice of friend and collaborator <mark>Captain Sensible</mark>, the Cleaners signed to independent label <mark>Ammunition Communications</mark>, releasing <mark>Going to England in 1987</mark>, a re-recorded version of Victoria Grey.</p>
<p>The same year, they received a two-record deal from <mark>RCA Deutschland</mark>, recording <mark>Town And Country</mark> in late 1987. Tensions began to rise, with Newell feeling unsatisfied with the album, and uncomfortable with the band's direction, culminating in him leaving the band in Spring of 1988. With a promotional tour for &quot;Town And Country&quot; already planned, Smith  was forced to take over as frontman, and the band's lackluster performance on tour <em>[combined with poor album sales]</em> led to RCA cancelling their deal later that year.</p>
<p>The bankruptcy of Ammunition Communications later the same year marked the effective end of the Cleaners as a band. Newell continued making music in <mark>The Brotherhood of Lizards</mark>, and Smith took a reporting job for <mark>The Times</mark>.</p>
<p>Martin Newell would continue to occasionally release music as 'The Cleaners From Venus'. In 1990 he released <mark>Number 13 on cassette</mark>, some songs being later re-recorded for his 1993 solo studio album <mark>The Greatest Living Englishman</mark>.</p>
<h5>Renewed Interest &amp; Return</h5>
<p>Though the <em>Cleaners</em> fell into relative obscurity after their 1988 breakup, they have since gained an online cult following, beginning in the early 2000's. In 2010, Martin Newell returned to making music under the <em>Cleaners</em> name, and has released a dizzying number of albums since then. Most have surpassed the confines of cassette, and thus the scope of this site, but you should still check them out.</p>
<p><em>The Cleaners From</em> Venus has since been recognized as an influential figure in the early Cassette Culture and Home Recording movements, influencing artists such as <mark>Mac DeMarco</mark> and <mark>Cults</mark>, as well as receiving accolades from other notable cassette culture figures, such as <mark>R. Stevie Moore</mark>.</p>
