  <h3>Frequency Assisted Questions</h3>

    <mark>"what the hell does 'one true faith' mean?"</mark>
    <br><br>this was originally a site for my cult but it got boring real fast
    and I like tapes better so here we are
    <br><br>
    <mark>"What about <a href="https://tape-mag.com">tape-mag.com?</a>"</mark>
    <br><br>Well I just kinda don't like it [?] I'm of course incredibly grateful that the site
    runners and users have put so much effort into preserving cassette culture, It's just that the 
    site can feel and look a little clinical at times, sometimes even notable profiles are left blank.
    <br><br>
    I'll of course never be able to reach the scale of them, but I think I can beat them with
    how much care I put into each article.

    I can get away with using them because this site is educational. Also because most of these
    artists wouldn't care. However, these are still very much under copyright. So watch yirself.
